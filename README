VEForAll extension

Version 0.1

VEForAll ("VisualEditor For All") is a MediaWiki extension that provides
the ability for other extensions to make use of VisualEditor within
textareas. VEForAll does not do anything on its own; rather, it defines a
JavaScript function, applyVisualEditor(), which can be called on any
textarea input.

As you might expect, the VisualEditor extension must be installed for VEForAll
to work.

This extension includes several files (ApiParsoidUtils.php, Container.php,
ExceptionHandling.php, Utils.php) that were mostly copied from the
corresponding files in the StructuredDiscussions extension, formerly known
as Flow. See that extension for attribution.
